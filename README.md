Overview

This project modernizes the data infrastructure for Dream Homes NYC, a growing real-estate brokerage that previously depended on fragmented spreadsheets to manage customers, properties, agents, and transactions. Our goal was to construct a reliable, scalable relational database and build the associated ETL and analytics pipeline needed for real-world decision-making. Since no internal data was accessible, we generated a wholly synthetic dataset that replicates the structure of modern real-estate portals such as Zillow and StreetEasy. The finished system supports sophisticated analytical queries, offers a centralized source of truth, and seamlessly interfaces with business intelligence tools.
